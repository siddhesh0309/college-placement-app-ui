Subject: Clarification on ACED Records in buyfp and vfin Files

Hi [Recipient’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

While reviewing the data, I noticed that in the buyfp file, ACED IL and ACED PL are present, whereas in the vfin file, the records show ACED LT and ACED PL.

Could you please confirm if there is any relationship or similarity between ACED IL and ACED LT? I want to ensure we are mapping or interpreting the data correctly.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,
